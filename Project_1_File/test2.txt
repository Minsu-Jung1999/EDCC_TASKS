Once upon a time, there was a handsome princess named Jung.
She lived in a cool castle made of sword in the land of WA.
One day, while wandering in the forest, she stumbled upon a group of fsdlfjk.
They were dancing and singing around a dfkl;dskjfl and invited the princess to join them.
As she danced, she felt jf and free, forgetting all her royal duties.
But when she returned to the castle, she was scolded by her sjdf mother, the queen.
From that day on, the princess would sneak out to the forest to dance with the ds,
but always made sure to return to her fds castle before anyone noticed.
